            <p>Designing a webpage can be really difficult especially if you aren't someone who fully understands
                what makes different websites stand out from the rest. Most people could probably see that this
                website is unpleasant to look at.

                But you might want to understand what exactly makes a website pleasing to look at and that's
                where the CRAP design principles come in. They are a set of basic instructions which provide
                much more nuance to the discussion of what makes a website well put together or not. With a
                decent understanding of these principles you can organize your website to look like something
                people will genuinely want to use to get their information. We provide detailed looks at all four
                design principles with visual examples, as well as a quiz for each principle.
